Write a program that counts the number of characters up to the first $ in input and
that leaves the $ in the input stream.
2. Write a program that copies your keyboard input (up to the simulated end-of-file)
to a file named on the command line.
3. Write a program that copies one file to another. Have the program take the filenames
from the command line. Have the program report if it cannot open a file.
4. Write a program that opens two text files for input and one for output.The program
should concatenate the corresponding lines of the input files, use a space as a
separator, and write the results to the output file. If one file is shorter than the other,
the remaining lines in the longer file should also be copied to the output file. For
example, suppose the first input file has these contents:
eggs kites donuts
balloons hammers
stones
And suppose the second input file has these contents:
zero lassitude
finance drama
The resulting file would have these contents:
eggs kites donuts zero lassitude
balloons hammers finance drama
stones
5. Mat and Pat want to invite their friends to a party, much as they did in Programming
Exercise 8 in Chapter 16, except now they want a program that uses files.
They have asked you to write a program that does the following:
n Reads a list of Mat’s friends’ names from a text file called mat.dat, which lists
one friend per line.The names are stored in a container and then displayed in
sorted order.
n Reads a list of Pat’s friends’ names from a text file called pat.dat, which lists
one friend per line.The names are stored in a container and then displayed in
sorted order.
n Merges the two lists, eliminating duplicates and stores the result in the file
matnpat.dat, one friend per line.
Consider the class definitions of Programming Exercise 5 in Chapter 14,“Reusing
Code in C++”. If you haven’t yet done that exercise, do so now.Then do the
following:
Write a program that uses standard C++ I/O and file I/O in conjunction with data
of types employee, manager, fink, and highfink, as defined in Programming Exercise
5 in Chapter 14.The program should be along the general lines of Listing 17.17
in that it should let you add new data to a file.The first time through, the program
should solicit data from the user, show all the entries, and save the information in a
file. On subsequent uses, the program should first read and display the file data, let the
user add data, and show all the data. One difference is that data should be handled by
an array of pointers to type employee.That way, a pointer can point to an employee
object or to objects of any of the three derived types. Keep the array small to facilitate
checking the program; for example, you might limit the array to 10 elements:
const int MAX = 10; // no more than 10 objects
...
employee * pc[MAX];
For keyboard entry, the program should use a menu to offer the user the choice of
which type of object to create.The menu should use a switch to use new to create
an object of the desired type and to assign the object’s address to a pointer in the pc
array.Then that object can use the virtual setall() function to elicit the appropriate
data from the user:
pc[i]->setall(); // invokes function corresponding to type of object
To save the data to a file, devise a virtual writeall() function for that purpose:
for (i = 0; i < index; i++)
pc[i]->writeall(fout);// fout ofstream connected to output file

Note
Use text I/O, not binary I/O, for Programming Exercise 6. (Unfortunately, virtual objects
include pointers to tables of pointers to virtual functions, and write() copies this information
to a file. An object filled by using read() from the file gets weird values for the function
pointers, which really messes up the behavior of virtual functions.) Use a newline character
to separate each data field from the next; this makes it easier to identify fields on input. Or
you could still use binary I/O, but not write objects as a whole. Instead, you could provide
class methods that apply the write() and read() functions to each class member individually
rather than to the object as a whole. That way, the program could save just the
intended data to a file.

The tricky part is recovering the data from the file.The problem is, how can the
program know whether the next item to be recovered is an employee object, a
manager object, a fink type, or a highfink type? One approach is, when writing
the data for an object to a file, precede the data with an integer that indicates the
type of object to follow.Then, on file input, the program can read the integer and
then use switch to create the appropriate object to receive the data:
enum classkind{Employee, Manager, Fink, Highfink}; // in class header
...
int classtype;
while((fin >> classtype).get(ch)){ // newline separates int from data
switch(classtype) {
case Employee : pc[i] = new employee;
: break;
Then you can use the pointer to invoke a virtual getall() function to read the
information:
pc[i++]->getall();
7. Here is part of a program that reads keyboard input into a vector of string objects,
stores the string contents (not the objects) in a file, and then copies the file contents
back into a vector of string objects:
int main()
{
using namespace std;
vector<string> vostr;
string temp;
// acquire strings
cout << "Enter strings (empty line to quit):\n";
while (getline(cin,temp) && temp[0] != '\0')
vostr.push_back(temp);
cout << "Here is your input.\n";
for_each(vostr.begin(), vostr.end(), ShowStr);
// store in a file
ofstream fout("strings.dat", ios_base::out | ios_base::binary);
for_each(vostr.begin(), vostr.end(), Store(fout));
fout.close();
// recover file contents
vector<string> vistr;
ifstream fin("strings.dat", ios_base::in | ios_base::binary);
if (!fin.is_open())
{
cerr << "Could not open file for input.\n";
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
GetStrs(fin, vistr);
cout << "\nHere are the strings read from the file:\n";
for_each(vistr.begin(), vistr.end(), ShowStr);
return 0;
}
Note that the file is opened in binary format and that the intention is that I/O be
accomplished with read() and write(). Quite a bit remains to be done:
n Write a void ShowStr(const string &) function that displays a string
object followed by a newline character.
n Write a Store functor that writes string information to a file.The Store
constructor should specify an ifstream object, and the overloaded
operator()(const string &) should indicate the string to write.A workable
plan is to first write the string’s size to the file and then write the string
contents. For example, if len holds the string size, you could use this:
os.write((char *)&len, sizeof(std::size_t)); // store length
os.write(s.data(), len); // store characters
The data() member returns a pointer to an array that holds the characters in
the string. It’s similar to the c_str() member except that the latter appends a
null character.
n Write a GetStrs() function that recovers information from the file. It can
use read() to obtain the size of a string and then use a loop to read that
many characters from the file, appending them to an initially empty temporary
string. Because a string’s data is private, you have to use a class method to
get data into the string rather than read directly into it.
